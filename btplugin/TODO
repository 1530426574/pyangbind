## TODO: every datatype actually needs to be able to be undef or a value -
## default values should not exist so need to wrap each class in a wrapper that
## lets undef be set. this is to ensure that when we serialise the object to
## send over NETCONF or protobuf then we do not need to send all elements unless
##Â we have explicitly set the variable.

## TODO: Rules can be implemented by having all _set* methods call a generic
## _obj_validate - this can be defined on a per-container basis, or just at the
## base of the module. When defined at the base of the module, then we need to
## call parent validate() methods for all sub-objects.

## TODO: we need to define dynamic types - so read through typedefs and then
## define new types.

## TODO: we have to handle unsafe names other than those with "-" in them --
## which might mean that we rename some of the YANG module variables. for
## instance, we need to change 'global' which exists in the BGP model.
